				<div class="col-md-8 text-left">
					<H3 class="subtitle">What is Web</H3>
					<H4 class="textfile">The web is the interaction among following composite parts: computer+brower, internet, HTTP and servers. The main content transported through web is HTML documents. </H4>
					<H3 class="subtitle">What HTML Stands For</H3>
					<H4 class="textfile">HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain following parts: </H4>	
					<H4 class="textfile">* Text content (what you see)</H4>
					<H4 class="textfile">* Markup (what it looks like)</H4>
					<H4 class="textfile">* Reference to other documents</H4>
					<H4 class="textfile">* Links to other pages</H4>
					<H3 class="subtitle">Tages and Elements</H3>
					<H4 class="textfile">HTML documents are made of HTML elements. Tags are basic elements used by HTML.</H4>
					<H3 class="subtitle">Computers are Stupid</H3>
					<H4 class="textfile">Computers are stupid because they are sensitive to typos. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.</H4>
					<H3 class="subtitle">Inline vs Block Elements</H3>
					<H4 class="textfile">HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</H4>
				</div>

			<div class="row" style="display:flex;outline:5px solid red;margin-left:15px;margin-right:15px">
				<div class="col-md-4 text-center"><H3 style="margin-bottom:30px;font-weight:550;">Lesson 2 - Creating a Structured Document with HTML</H3></div>
				<div class="col-md-8 text-left">
					<H3 class="subtitle">Developer Tools (in the Browser)</H3>
					<H4 class="textfile">HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them. </H4>
					<H3 class="subtitle">The "tree-like structure" of HTML</H3>
					<H4 class="textfile">The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. The relationship between elements is like family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...
					In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...</H4>

					<H3 class="subtitle">The relationship between indented HTML and boxes</H3>
					<H4 class="textfile">When you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.</H4>

					<H3 class="subtitle">Text Editors (for programming)</H3>
					<H4 class="textfile">When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.</H4>

				<div class="col-md-8 text-left">
					<H3 class="subtitle">Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons. </H3>
					<H4 class="textfile">
					Avoiding Errors: When programmers don't avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise. 
					</h4>
					<H4 class="textfile">
					Consistency: In this web page, I wanted every lesson to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I was able to assign each lesson div the same class and then specify the style for that class in only one place! By avoiding repetition, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style. 
					</H4>	
					<H3 class="subtitle">CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</H3>
					<H4 class="textfile">CSS give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same class name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.</H4>
					<H3 class="subtitle">HTML Page Design Process: </H3>
					<H4 class="textfile">1.	Looking for natural boxes --> 2. Looking for repeated style and semantic elements --> 3. Writing HTML code --> 4.	Applying styles (From BIGGEST to smallest) --> 5. Fixing things.</H4>
